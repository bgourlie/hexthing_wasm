This repo contains a simple hex grid renderer written in rust targeting web assembly. It also integrates the specs entity component system (the first such example that exists as far as I'm aware) but is unable to do rendering within a render loop due to certain constraints outline in [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53000413/how-can-i-work-around-not-being-able-to-export-functions-with-lifetimes-when-usi).
